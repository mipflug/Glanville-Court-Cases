# Glanville-Court-Cases
## Introduction
This repository contains in-progress encodings of court documents pertaining to the entomologist Eleanor Glanville (1655-1709).
Approximately 35 court cases were photographed by Michele D. Pflug at the UK National Archives in summer 2022. Transcription of a
major court case, Ashfield v. Goodricke (C5/222/25), began in fall 2022 using Notion code blocks, which were linked to a primary source
index and a biographical index within Notion. Encoding began in Spring 2023 using Leaf-Writer. 

The court case C5/222/25 contains a total of 2 bundles and 19 folios. The documents consist of the pleadings and depositions. 

This project has been supported by the following institutions:
