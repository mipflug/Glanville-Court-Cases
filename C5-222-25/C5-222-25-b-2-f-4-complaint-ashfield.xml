 his said Mothers Children as the same is attempted by the said Confederates to be Your Orat<expan>o</expan>r [or] any of the said other Children having never been extravagent or disobedient or undutifull to their said Mother And if your Orator has ever owned himselfe guilty of any such thing by letter or otherwise<lb/>
 It was so written &amp; done only to please her and if your Orat<expan>o</expan>rs said Mother did make any such Will or deed of appointment to or in favour of the said Sir Henry Goodrick as aforesaid Yet the Same was not pursuant to her power or not duely executed or attested Nor had she any the least [Colone]<lb/>
 of authority to make an Executor But p<expan>er</expan>ticularly (tho with great Reluctancy) Your Orat<expan>o</expan>r doth charge as the [hirth] is that his said Mother was not a woman of a Sound Sedate &amp; disposing mind memory or understanding of of a due Sanity of mind &amp; Capacity of und<expan>e</expan>rstanding to make a will or<lb/>
 dispose of her Estate for that after the s<expan>ai</expan>d Seperac<expan>i</expan>on of her &amp; her husband &amp; She not being able to hear any thing of him not Soe much as whether he went or what became of him nor whether he was dead or living She became very Melancholy occa<expan>s</expan>ioned sometime by her reflecting on her Conduct<lb/>
 towards him &amp; at other times by her dread of his returne &amp; avenging himselfe on her as the pretended he threatned at his departure She became Lunatick &amp; not capable of managing her Estate much lesse of the disposing of the Inheritance of it Insomuch that she did not make cleere Fifty<lb/>
 pounds p<expan>er</expan> ann<expan>um</expan> of her whole Estate as she upon Occac<expan>i</expan>on deposed &amp; She lived under the rate of Fifty pounds a yeare to all appearances &amp; Yet [fit be tine] as the Confederates pretend She hath so extravagantly run out of &amp; charged her Estate as afores<expan>ai</expan>d &amp; in respect of her Family she was often<lb/>
 without any Cause in [clead] sometimes of her Tennants Sometimes of her Servants Sometimes of her Children &amp; at other times of all of them that they would kill her or at least betray &amp; deliver her up to her husband who as she pretended intended to carry her into a forreigne Country where none of her friends<lb/>
 should ever see or hear of her &amp; Chain her to a post &amp; feed her only with bread &amp; water [Allas] her said husband never attempted to come near her nor so much as troubled himselfe about her nor did he ever send to or any ways correspond with them or any of them nor had She the least ground for any Such<lb/>
 [thrends] or Fear But Yet she would hide herselfe &amp; Sometimes lock herselfe upp from them &amp; at other times goe they knew not where &amp; Sometimes beyond the [Seas] &amp; She was so farr distracted in her mind that She proposed to have her Bull paced to make a pad of him &amp; have her houses thatched with<lb/>
 pebles or round stones to have Man cutt down a tree of severall Tons &amp; carry it on his Back to make a Ladder &amp; use without her necessary Cloaths to goe out at break of day on the Do[wnes] amongst the Fa[rze] &amp; gather Butterflyes worms &amp; other Insects in order as she would Say to Send them<lb/>
 to London to have their pictures drawne &amp; as may be instanced in many other things &amp; Soe unaccountably She behaved herselfe towards her Children that when Your Orator came of age of One &amp; twenty Yeares She sent him to the West Indies with only twenty pounds Stock to make a Merchant of him as She<lb/>
 pretended &amp; he having the misfortune to be taken by French privateer and being afterwards taken by an Englishman of [hiarr] &amp; brought home She forbad her Servants &amp; Tennants to receive or entertain him or so much as to allow him a Bed &amp; would have had him hanged as a pyrate And afterwards<lb/>
 she did assigne him a Farme of thirty pounds per ann<expan>um</expan> for three yeares to live on &amp; Set him up a Farmer on it &amp; gave him Some [Sheepe] &amp; Cattle manage it with a [xxxx] Your Orat<expan>o</expan>r did with great diligence &amp; Industry for about Six weekes when She took occas<expan>i</expan>on to send Your Orator from home in an Errand for her &amp;<lb/>
 on the morrow before Your Orator could possibly returne she took away all his stock again giving out that the Farmer meaning Your Orator was broke &amp; [runn] away &amp; on that occas<expan>i</expan>on at his returne obliging him under Colour of [re]signing up the said Farm to her &amp; without any well Considerat<expan>i</expan>on to<lb/>
 release or assigne to her all his Interest in the whole Estate of his Ancestors &amp; [farme] the [r]ented [estate] now [unjustly] make use against Your Orator &amp; She Sent Your Orat<expan>o</expan>r to board at a papists house in Cheshire whether at her Comand he went with only one Guinea in his pocket &amp; being come thither the house appeared to be<lb/>
 full before &amp; Your Orator was refused recep<expan>c</expan>ion to that he was forced to begg his way home &amp; afterwards she p<expan>er</expan>swaded your Orator to goe to a Monastary in Flanders &amp; become a Monk altho She had not given him Educa<expan>c</expan>ion or opportunity of learning exceeding the quality of a parish clerke And Your Orator<lb/>
 humbly shewed his dislike of such an undertaking but in obedience to her Submitted to her pleasure &amp; accordingly went to [xxxxxx] in Flanders to a Monastary there to [w<expan>hic</expan>h] he was directed &amp; there continued about nine Months when he found that instead of a Monk he was to be but a Monks Servant [w<expan>hic</expan>h]<lb/>
 as he conceived he had no reason to Submitt to but refused so to be &amp; returned home begging his way having had of his <add>said</add> Mother but Five pounds to support him in the nine months expedic<expan>i</expan>on And afterwards she would have him goe to France to be as she said bredd a Gentleman &amp; accordingly at her Comand he went to a<lb/>
 Gentleman She directed there where Your Orator continued about two yeares &amp; in all that time had but half a Guinea of her of her so that for want he was for want he was forced to returne home &amp; in Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>rs absence it being reported that he was dead Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>rs s<expan>ai</expan>d mother s<expan>ai</expan>d she [w<expan>oul</expan>d] give Five pounds for the Certainty thereof for that then She s<expan>ai</expan>d She could Sell<lb/>
 her Estate &amp; live in London &amp; She Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>rs said Mother sent yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>rs s<expan>ai</expan>d sister to a Nunnery in France in order to become a [Nunn]as Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>rs Mother pretended but after her Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>rs s<expan>ai</expan>d Sister's Continuance in the s<expan>ai</expan>d Nunnery about a Yeare she found that her s<expan>ai</expan>d Mother would not give a Sum<expan>m</expan>e with her to p[roince] her a Sisterhood but<lb/>
 that she was only to be Lay sister in the nature of Se[rvitude] to the Nunns [Viz.] she refused to accept &amp; so returned home And yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>r doth charge that as a further proofe of his said Mother's Melancholy &amp; F[renzy] if she as the Confederates pretend as aforesaid did fancy her selfe to be an Impostor And that she<lb/>
 was not the Child of your Orat<expan>o</expan>rs s<expan>ai</expan>d Grandfather &amp; Grandmother &amp; that she to doe Justice would [restore] the Estate to the Goodricks from whence It is [pertaine] that She wanted understanding for that [<expan>th</expan>e] Estate was never of that Family But in Case She Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>rs s<expan>ai</expan>d mother had been an Impostor the Estate would &amp;<lb/>
 ought to have gone to the heires of the s<expan>ai</expan>d Rice Davies &amp; not the s<expan>ai</expan>d Sir Henry Goodricke who by any thing Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>r [can] find was not any wayes or at [least] but very remotely related to yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>rs s<expan>ai</expan>d Grandfather Goorick or Mother &amp; not knowne to her She having never seen or conversed with him but Such<lb/>
 Improvement had such Fancy of hers aforesaid on her that at length She fancyed that your Orator &amp; all other her own Children were Impostors or Changlings &amp; that they had been all changed at Nurse &amp; that they were none of her Children &amp; so she declared at or about the time of her making &amp; executing<lb/>
 the s<expan>ai</expan>d pretended Will &amp; deed of appointm<expan>en</expan>t &amp; offered the same as her only or at least cheife reason for disinheriting as She termed it her Children &amp; said that she so settled her Estate on <expan>th</expan>e s<expan>ai</expan>d S<expan>i</expan>r Henry Goodrick that in Case her husband should take &amp; carry her into Captivity the said S<expan>i</expan>r Henry might have<lb/>
 when[ce with all] of her Estate to redeeme &amp; releive her &amp; the said very [Nice] &amp; deed are in themselves as Your Orator is advised plain [Eordince] of his said Mothers Insanity of mind for that by the Same She hath as as is pretended given One hundred pounds a peice to two persons who are no Relac<expan>i</expan>ons but only<lb/>
 Romish priests &amp; an Annuity of ten pounds per Ann<expan>um</expan> to a poor Alms house man no wayes related to her &amp; but ten pounds a peice to your Orators &amp; two other of her Children &amp; Five shillings a week to the other &amp; gave all <expan>th</expan>e rest of her Estate to the said Sir Henry Goodrick who was not related or<lb/>
 [IMG_0389; IMG_0390; IMG_0391]<lb/>
 knowne to her otherwise then as She had heard that he or his late father dec<expan>eas</expan>ed in his life time had obtained the Entayls of <del>xxx</del> the Estate of Old Sir Henry Goodrick deceased[viz] before stood Setled &amp; Entayled on Your Orators s<expan>ai</expan>d Mother to be barred for that Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orators said Mother Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>r were<lb/>
 papists &amp; the Same Estate [viz] is very considerable to be settled on him &amp; Yet in favour of him the said Sir Henry Goodrick Your Orators said Mother hath if that the said [hice] &amp; deed doe Stand [ralied] not only disinherited Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>r but left him &amp; the rest of her Children to starve having not<lb/>
 bredd them to any professions or Imployments whereby to get their bread &amp; this done on pretence of their Extravagence &amp; disobedience &amp; change of Religion when as they were never extravagent having never had any thing to be Extravagent with all nor did Your Orator ever spend Forty pounds per<lb/>
 Ann<expan>um</expan> one yeare with another or any part of his time Nor was he or any of her other Children ever disobedient in the least to her but alwayes most dutifull Nor had Your Orator reformed or changed his Religion before the pretended making of the said will or deed Nor had either of the other said<lb/>
 Children reformed or changed their religion at her death &amp; one of them hath not Yet reformed nor did any of them ever give their said Mother any just &amp; reasonable Cause of offence &amp; Your Orat<expan>o</expan>r is advised &amp; doth humbly Insist that in Case it Shall appeare that his s<expan>ai</expan>d Mother had any power of dispos<expan>sess</expan>ion of<lb/>
 the pr<expan>e</expan>m<expan>iss</expan>es or any part thereof &amp; that she had a reasonable Capacity of mind &amp; understanding soe to doe &amp; that she did really make such Will and deed of appointment of her Estate to the said Sir Henry Henry Goodrick Yet that she being a Feme Covert had not power by the words of the said<lb/>
 deed of Declara<expan>c</expan>ion of the Trust vested in the said Mr Gorges and Mr Rogers to dispose of the same further then to Some person or persons in being at the time of making thereof And that the words leases Grants and Estates in the said Declara<expan>cio</expan>n of Trust Comprized have not a direct<lb/>
 rela<expan>c</expan>ion to the disposi<expan>c</expan>ion of the Inheritance but ought to have a benign &amp; favourable Construc<expan>c</expan>ion in respect of your Orator who otherwise is to be disinherited &amp; left to perish &amp; those words ought to be [appeyed] as they were intended only to the making of leases &amp; granting Estates for [lives]<lb/>
 by Coppy of Court roll amending to the Customs of the said Mann<expan>o</expan>rs the greatest part of the said prem<expan>iss</expan>es consisting of Tenements usually so leased and granted for Fines under small rents and which Fines were a Considerable part of the Yearly Income of the said Estate And<lb/>
 the Same doe appeare the more plainly to have beene so intended for that the disposicion of Inheritance is the Creating of but one Estate and those leases grants and Estates were to have been repeated [outs] from time to time as occac<expan>i</expan>on required when as the disposi<expan>c</expan>ion of the Inheritance could<lb/>
 have been but once done And Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orator doth likewise Insist as his said Mother hath by the said pretended Will &amp; deed of appointment directed the debts on the said Estate to be paid in the first place So in Case the said Will &amp; deed shall be adjudged to be of any effect the said Sir Henry Goodrick ought<lb/>
 to pay &amp; discharge the same debts &amp; Incumbrances &amp; to Convey the Inheritance of the said premisses [viz] he hath so unjustly obtained from the heires of the said Mr Rogers to your Orat<expan>o</expan>rs &amp; his heires in Reverc<expan>i</expan>on of his the said Sir Henry Goodricks life for that by the said Will &amp; deed of appointm<expan>en</expan>t noe<lb/>
 greater Estate ought to passe to him then for his life as Your Orat<expan>o</expan>r is advised And yo<expan>u</expan>r Orat<expan>o</expan>r hath humbly requested the said Sir Henry Goodrick to Convey the Same accordingly but he refuseth so to doe &amp; he &amp; all the said other Confederates persisted all their practices aforesaid ag<expan>ains</expan>t Your Orator<lb/>
 contrary to Equity &amp; Good Conscience and [viz] tend to Your poor Orators utter ruine In Tender Considera<expan>c</expan>ion whereof and for that Yo<expan>u</expan>r Orator [concerned] lesse in the prem<expan>iss</expan>es Save by the Oaths of the said Confederates who when called thereto [Will] as Your Orator humbly hopes discover &amp; produce the<lb/>
