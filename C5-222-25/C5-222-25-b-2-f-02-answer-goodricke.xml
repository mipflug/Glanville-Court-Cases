 he hath been constrained to sett the premisses in repair which will cost more moneys then the income of the Estate will raise for some years and this Def<expan>endan</expan>t hath also made sev<expan>er</expan>all Leases for lives to sev<expan>er</expan>all Tennants at Rodney Stoke and taken such Fines as he could gett therefore (having as he is advised) good right to doe and hopes he may doe And this<lb/>
 Def<expan>endan</expan>t hath heard that the said Elianor Glanville in her life time sold some Lands in Loxton but to whoms or for what knows not And this Def<expan>endan</expan>t confesseth he hath often heard and verily beleives that the pl<expan>aintiff </expan>was very extravagant in his way of living and very undutifull to his mother having seen sev<expan>er</expan>all Letters and papers of hers to that<lb/>
 purpose which he beleives was the occasion of her Disinheriting of him and not for the pretended reason in the Bill of his being reformed from the Errors of the Romish Church which he takes to be a meer ficc<expan>i</expan>on of the Pl<expan>aintiff</expan> Because this Def<expan>endan</expan>t hath been informed he still continues a Roman Catholique Besides had that been any reason<lb/>
 it must consequently have been an Objecc<expan>i</expan>on against her settleing the same on this Def<expan>endan</expan>t who never was a member of the Church of Rome <unclear>buth</unclear> hath ever been both by educac<expan>i</expan>on and Inclinac<expan>i</expan>on a member of the Church of England And this Def<expan>endan</expan>t doth confesse that he hath declared and as the truth is that the said Edward Gorges dyed first and the said<lb/>

 of this hono<expan>ura</expan>ble Court humbly hopes was lawfull for him to Doe And this Defendant Confesseth he had no p<expan>er</expan>ticuler acquaintance with or personall knowledge of the pl<expan>aintif</expan>f<expan>s </expan>said Mother having to his knowledge never seen her or Corresponded with her and therefore cannot give any account as to her Sanity of mind and understanding and Denyes<lb/>
 he was ever Informed she was a Lunatick or Crazy <add>except by the Complainant or his Agents</add> But hath been informed and verily beleives and Doubts not but to prove she was a p<expan>er</expan>son of very good sence and understanding and very well knew what she Did and how to Manage and dispose of her Estate And that the considerac<expan>i</expan>on of the great Debt thereupon and the <unclear>carelesness</unclear> and<lb/>
 negligance of the Pl<expan>aintiff</expan>s was such that he would soon have wasted and sold the same was the great Inducement of her leaving the same to and settleing it upon this Def<expan>endan</expan>t upon a prospect and hopes that this Def<expan>endan</expan>t <unclear>would</unclear> pr<expan>e</expan>serve the same as being a very near Relac<expan>i</expan>on to witt <add>a Son of</add> a Cozen German once removed and of the Sirname of her Father by whose prudence<lb/>
 her Estate had been preserved for her as this Def<expan>endan</expan>t beleives And this Def<expan>endan</expan>t utterly Denyes that said Elianor Glanvilles said Will or appointment was to his knowledge or beleife made to him upon any Trust whatsoever or for any other End intent or purpose save what is therein expressed And as to all other the Charges and Allegac<expan>i</expan>ons in <unclear>the</unclear> said<lb/>

 informed the writt on which he was arrested did not require Speciall Bayle and the Pl<expan>aintiff</expan> gave only an Appearance thereto and finding the Pl<expan>aintiff</expan> not p<expan>er</expan>sist in his Injurys the Cause was Dropt and noe further proceedings therein as this Def<expan>endan</expan>t hath been informed by his Attorney And this Def<expan>endan</expan>t Denyes all Combinac<expan>i</expan>on in the Bill charged without<lb/>
